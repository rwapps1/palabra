  // ---- Hardware/browser back button ------------------------------------
  // By default a phone's back button/gesture has nothing of this app's own
  // to act on (no history entries are pushed anywhere), so it falls straight
  // through to whatever's underneath - the previous website in a normal
  // browser tab, or closing the Activity entirely in the APK. This section
  // makes back navigate within the app instead, using the History API.
  //
  // Design: every non-floor screen gets its own real history entry - no
  // attempt to collapse multiple menu levels into a shared slot (an earlier
  // version tried that and broke as soon as the user went two levels deep,
  // e.g. Achievements -> an achievement group - because going deeper just
  // relabelled the one entry instead of adding a new one, so there was only
  // ever a single real pop available no matter how many screens you'd
  // actually visited). Landing back on the floor (start/login) instead
  // sheds everything accumulated in one `history.go()` jump, so exact depth
  // never has to matter once you're home again - a further back press there
  // genuinely exits (closes the APK / leaves to the previous page).
  //
  // Every screen falls into exactly one of three special buckets:
  //   - floor: start, login - see above.
  //   - swallow: round-end / celebration screens - back does nothing at
  //     all. These are reached automatically (timers, round completion),
  //     never chosen by the user, so there's nothing sensible to return to.
  //   - quit: the four active-play screens - back triggers the exact same
  //     "quit this round?" confirm as the on-screen Quit button, not real
  //     navigation.
  // Everything else (menu/setup/detail screens) already has its own
  // "back-btn" wired by its render function - hardware back just clicks it,
  // so behavior is guaranteed identical to tapping the on-screen arrow, and
  // the resulting screen change re-arms itself the normal way below.

  // it" and "it actually resolved" during which the app is still usable. If
  // a genuine user gesture triggers syncBackHistory() -> pushState() inside
  // that window, the two navigations race: depending on timing, our
  // in-flight forward() can resolve *after* the fresh pushState(), silently
  // reordering the stack. That race is what produced the confirmed bug
  // where a second "Quit" attempt (after cancelling the first) sent the
  // user out of the app instead of showing the confirm dialog again -
  // ignoreNextPopstate + forward() from the cancelled attempt was still
  // in flight when the second attempt's real state change tried to push.

  // inside a timer callback has no trusted user gesture behind it, and the
  // browser can (and, per the confirmed live bug, does) silently skip that
  // entry on the very next real back press: from the browser's perspective
  // an untrusted-context pushState looks identical to a page trying to trap
  // the back button. That's exactly what was happening - Celebrate -> Result
  // were both reached via this same timer-driven path, but only Result
  // being a real (non-swallow) screen made the skipped entry actually
  // matter, so back on Result fell through to whatever was two entries back
  // instead of one and exited the app. replaceState() sidesteps the problem
  // entirely: it never adds a new entry for the anti-abuse heuristic to
  // skip. The trade-off - the screen being left behind has its entry
  // overwritten rather than kept underneath - is fine here because every
